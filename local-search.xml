    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the third paper interpretation about the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. This paper is about the reproductive and metabolic dysfunction which passed transgenerationally due to the polycystic ovary syndrome. This paper, unlike the previous two, including the observation and data collection on human which is rarely seen in TEI research field as experiment or observation including human across several generation is commonly considered as costly and inconveniently. </p><p>In this paper “Transgenerational transmission of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction in the male progeny of polycystic ovary syndrome(Risal et al., 2023)”, the researchers uses mice as model in replace of human to verify the observation that the son of the polycystic ovary syndrome will increase the chance of getting obese. The researchers also verified that this transgenerational effect is induced by the small RNA expression change. At the same time, the effect is on maternal side rather than paternal side which not similar to the previous two papers. </p> <img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/abstract3.png" class="" title="image here"><p><strong>Research Background</strong></p><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is a disease that causes the infertility of female and often induced other kinds of disease like type 2 diabetes. The disease is common linking with syndrome like overly obese which the researchers also observe in the offspring of the patients. Also recent studies have found that the genetic factors for PCOS will also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, ß-cell dysfunction. The similar obesity syndrome is also observed across the generation as far as to F3 generation indicated by some researchers. </p><p><strong>Experiment Object</strong></p><p>In this experiment, the researchers want to determine the deep mechanism for the young age obesity of the child of PCOS woman and also identified differentially expressed gene of small RNA through the GWAS associative analysis. Then the researchers will turn to the mice model by using prenatal androgen exposure to mimic the PCOS syndrome and showing that the obesity effect will be passed transgenerationally to F3 generation and which mechanism takes for this transgenerational effect. </p><p><strong>Experiment Result</strong></p><ol><li><p>The PCOS son will have altered lipid circulation profile compare to the normal child. The data sample indicates the increase cholesterol concentration and circulation of low density lipoprotein(LDL) for the PCOS sons. Also as the mother have higher BMI which indicates obesity, the son of the obesity mother will also have higher BMI compare to the control group child with mothers’ BMI lower than 25. </p><img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/obese.png" class="" title="image here"></li><li><p>The researchers then using the sncRNA analysis of serum of PCOS son identifies miRNA targeted loci risk gene of PCOS. hsa-miR-1299, hsa-miR-122-5p, hsa-miR-199b- 3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-1307-3p, hsa-miR-96- 5p, and hsa-miR-548ar-3p are the 7 DEmiRNA that found both in PCOS son and PCOS mother which indicates the potential of these 7 DEmiRNAs as the factor gene for PCOS. </p><img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/chart.png" class="" title="image here"><img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/graph.png" class="" title="image here"></li><li><p>Using mice model, the researchers found that PCOS will cause transgenerational reproductive syndrome to the further generation. The lower testis weight is observed in these PCOS mice offspring F1 and F2 generation, even the only slightly difference is observed in the F3 generation, the profound effect of androgenized and obesity is still existed by decreasing the fertility rate and also lowering the testis weight. When the paternal is treated with androgen and the maternal side is also in obesity, the transgenerationally metabolic dysfunction is also observed in the offspring and the syndrome like higher liver triglyceride is also observed in the F3 generation.</p></li></ol> <img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/miRNA-dif.png" class="" title="image here"><p><strong>Possible Mechanism</strong></p><p>The study of transgenerational transmission of reproductive and metabolic dysfunction across male offspring of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) provides strong evidence concerning the impact of maternal health status on offspring beyond the generation immediately affected. No longer a disease of concern only to female reproductive health, PCOS is now shown to have long-term impacts in male offspring in terms of fertility, hormone level, and metabolic profile.</p> <img src="/2025/06/21/paper-interpretation-3/mechanism3.png" class="" title="image here"><p><strong>Importance and Impact</strong></p><p> This research emphasizes that PCOS should not be perceived merely as an ovarian dysfunction in females but rather as an illness having systemic and inheritable implications. Evidence of disruption of metabolism and fertility in male offspring provides evidence of epigenetic mechanisms in transmitting responses to hormonal disruption in the mother. This evidence may shift clinic perception, potentially to earlier and family-centered therapy in managing PCOS.</p><p>Moreover, this research contributes to the expanding body of evidence supporting the influence of prenatal and perinatal conditions as the principal predictors of long-term health. This research also necessitates increased caution and tracking of those children born to persons afflicted with endocrine or metabolic disorders. Lastly, the research provides further depth into the transmission of disease and introduces such timely questions as prevention, diagnosis, and treatment procedures in both sexes and across generations.</p><p>Risal, S., Li, C., Luo, Q., Fornes, R., Lu, H., Eriksson, G., Manti, M., Ohlsson, C., Lindgren, E., Crisosto, N., Maliqueo, M., Echiburú, B., Recabarren, S., Petermann, T.

    <title>Paper Interpretation-2-RNA-Dependent Intergenerational Inheritance of Enhanced Synaptic Plasticity after Environmental Enrichment</title>
    <link href="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/"/>
    <url>/2025/06/20/Enrichment/</url>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the second interpretation about the article in Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) area, planning to do 4 paper interpretation within this area and then shift to next area like the maize production, genetic engineering, biological engineer etc.</p><p>This paper is relatively ‘rare’ in the field of TEI, as it focuses on the effect of positive environmental stimulation on the transgenerational effect on mice. The environmental enrichment (EE) is presented to be effective to improve mice’s cognitive ability and other behavior through affecting the miR212&#x2F;132 families. </p><p><strong>Research background</strong></p><p>The environmental enrichment is long been observed to increase the cognitive abilities in both human and mice. It is though that the effect of EE is related to the plasticity of hippocampus and the response of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Also, the EE has effect on decreasing the chance of getting cognitive disease in later stage life of mice. Combining the above knowledge with the recent evidence about the small RNA transgenerational effect in gamete makes the researchers hypotheses that the effect of EE may pass to next generation or further generation using TEI. </p><p><strong>Experiment Object</strong></p><p>The object of this experiment is to determine whether the effect of EE will transfer to the further generation and also testing for the effect of EE on animal behavior. The TEI effect will be further analysis for the deeper mechanism that cause it and the analysis towards the small interfering RNA is also essential in this study. </p><p><strong>Experiment Result</strong></p><ol><li><p>EE training of the mice will increase the hippocampal synaptic plasticity through an intergenerational manner from the F0 generation to the F1 generation. The apparent enhancement in the field EPSP when comparing the EE training group with the control group indicate the effect is past to the second generation. However, the difference is vanished when observing the second generation F2 generation which indicates that effect is only happening intergenerationally.</p><p><img src="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/abstract.png" alt="image here"></p><img src="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/pie.png" class="" title="image  here"></li><li><p>The EE is transferred using sperm which indicates the male side effect on the first generation offspring. Also, apparent increase in expression of miR212&#x2F;132 is observed in both sperm and hippocampus of the F1 generation, while if the RNAi is injected into sperm, the increasing expression is not observed in the F1 generation, the field EPSP is returned to the normal value similar to the control group.</p></li></ol><p><img src="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/F1.png" alt="image here"> </p><img src="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/inhibitor.png" class="" title="image here"><p><strong>Possible Mechanism</strong></p><p>The intergenerational inheritance scheme fit the natural selection and rule, the nature would not allow enhancement in cognitive ability to persist if the environmental change and needs other adaptation to cater the new condition. The precise mechanism of how sperm small RNA differential expression generate and how this differential expression scheme persist to the next generation remain determined for this experiment. To note that, the miR212&#x2F;132 play a role in cognitive ability which verifies their differential expression is the cause of the EE. </p><img src="/2025/06/20/Enrichment/traingle.png" class="" title="image here"><p><strong>Importance and Impact</strong></p><p>The discovery that RNA-dependent mechanisms underlie the intergenerational transmission of increased synaptic plasticity after environmental enrichment is a key advance in neuroscience and epigenetics. What the research shows is that beneficial cognitive experience—like enriched environments—can influence the operation of the brain not just in the treated individual but also offspring, through non-DNA-sequence-based mechanisms.</p><p>The involvement in RNA pathways of these enhancements suggests a crucial role of epigenetic regulation in neuroplasticity. These processes upend traditional models of heredity by showing that experiential-acquired neural traits, previously considered non-heritable, are inheritable to subsequent generations. This has serious applications for how experiences such as education, stress, or trauma may influence descendents on the molecular and cognitive levels.</p><p>Moreover, this research opens up new lines of therapeutic intervention into RNA-mediated mechanisms for enhancing cognitive performance or intergenerational resilience. The research draws attention to the dynamic interaction of environment, gene control, and behavior, and stands as a paradigm for ongoing research into mechanisms by which life experience may exert enduring, transmissible influences on brain function. The research also indicates that environmental enrichment can be harnessed as a transgenerational cognitive-enhancement strategy.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a brief interpretation for the beginner in the research area that may not be quite understand the working mechanism of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) or other mechanism that related to this large research scope. The interpretation will be based on each research article and the content will be mainly focused on these sectors: Experiment method, Paper’s research object and result, mechanism tested, explanation for result and Importance of the paper. The paper interpretation will inevitably to use some graph or dataset present in the article to make sure the explanation is clear, these graph and data will not be used to generate new scientific content. The interpretation is just a showcase of how I read, understand and analysis this paper. </p><p>Here is the first paper, “Piwi&#x2F;PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-b Mediate Transgenerational Learned Pathogenic Avoidance” Moore et al. (Moore et al., 2019). The download link is for this paper and it is also free access version available for all researchers. This article is kind of one of the most important articles in TEI area and also the first article I read about the TEI. </p><p><strong>Research Background</strong></p><p>RNAi related TEI phenomenon is been widely observed from various animals and also experiments, ranging from different small noncoding RNA like piRNA, siRNA, tiRNA, microRNA etc. Choosing C. elegan as experiment subject is due to its easiness to control and also low cost to produce large amount of it. Also, the avoidance behavior of C. elegan towards P14 Pseudomonas can be treated as a learning behavior but also as a strong enough environmental stress that may cause genetic expression change within the C. elegan. </p><p><strong>Experiment Object</strong></p><p>The experiment is about testing the epigenetic transmission mechanism within C. elegans under the environmental stress like Pseudomonas. The Pseudomonas is presented to be attractive to the C. elegans but the toxicity within it is strong enough to change the epigenetic information of F0 generation C. elegans and lead to avoidance behavior learned from F1 generation to F4 generation. However, at F5 generation, the avoidance behavior is not observed and the behavior change back to F0 generation again. </p><p><strong>Experiment Result</strong> </p><ol><li><p>Learning the avoidance behavior will pass transgenerically through the TEI method and the avoidance behavior is specific to certain bacteria, that is PA14, but no response to other pseudomonas like S. marcescens. The train of behavior learning is presented through C. elegans’ apparent inclination to OP50 after exposure to PA14 compare to the naturally inclination to PA14 without any previous expose. The PA14 trained C. elegan show higher choice index towards OP50 for both 4 hour and 24 hour compare to control group. OP50 is harmless bacteria type for C. elegan to ingest. </p><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/control.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"></li><li><p>The avoidance behavior will pass no matter from maternal side or paternal side, both male and female germline demonstrate learned avoidance behavior after initial exposure. However, the learned avoidance only present with 4 generations and no apparent different is observed in the 5th generation. </p><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/generation.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"></li><li><p>Further detail indicates that the trait demonstration required DAF-7&#x2F;TGF-b presence and also ASI neurone. Apparent upregulation for ASI neuron is presented from F0 to F4 generation and if daf-7 gene is treated with RNAi or the C. elegan carries the mutant version, no different is observed when comparing the PA14 trained group and OP50 trained group. </p><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/ASI.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"></li><li><p>Other indication, piRNA demonstrate more downregulation(466) compare to upregulation(254). The piRNA is determined to be critical for the trait to transmit to the next generation, the absence of piRNA in F1 generation appear similar preference between two groups.</p><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/piRNA.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"></li></ol><p><strong>Possible Mechanism</strong></p><p>Based on the analysis of the researchers, the whole transmission process can be categorized into three steps: naïve preference, learn avoidance and transgenerational inheritance. Based on the table, one particular gene family is responsible for the naïve preference, some for learned while another for transgenerational inheritance.</p><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/mechanism.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"><img src="/2025/06/19/paper-interpretation-1/table.png" class="" title="this is a testing image"><p>Importance and Impact</p><p>The discovery that transgenerational learned pathogenic avoidance is mediated by Piwi&#x2F;PRG-1 Argonaute and TGF-β signaling is a significant advance in the knowledge of environmental experiences on heredity and behavior. The study provides significant insight into the molecular mechanisms through which animals, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, are able to inherit behavioral responses to pathogens without any change in their DNA sequence. The involvement of Piwi&#x2F;PRG-1, a protein already involved in epigenetic regulation by small RNAs, is suggestive of RNA-mediated encoding of transgenerational memory. That TGF-β signaling is involved highlights the intersection of classical developmental pathways and adaptive behavioral plasticity.</p><p>This mechanism of inheritance—bypassing genetic mutation but providing stable phenotypic change—has profound implications. It challenges traditional boundaries between innate and learned responses and underscores the evolutionary advantage of transmitting adaptive reactions to offspring. The findings not only rewrite the definition of inheritance but also have broader implications for fields ranging from neurobiology to disease treatment. If similar mechanisms are present in more complex organisms, it could have implications for studies on the heritability of stress responses, immune priming, or even trauma.</p><p>In effect, this study links molecular biology, neurogenetics, and evolution, suggesting a compelling example of how behavior and experience may affect lineage survival by inheritance that is not genetic in character. The paper emphasizes the part of epigenetic mechanisms in characterizing organismal adaptation and opens up new possibilities for discovering how life experiences can exert long-term biological consequences for generations.</p><p>Moore, R.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How does an entire encyclopedia fit inside a pinhead? How does your computer store thousands of files while letting you open any in an instant? The packaging of DNA in your cells accomplishes an even more astonishing feat - fitting 2 meters of DNA into a nucleus smaller than a speck of dust, while keeping every genetic instruction perfectly organized and instantly accessible!</p><p>The magic begins with <strong>nucleosomes</strong> - nature’s ingenious solution resembling tiny sewing spools. Each spool contains eight histone proteins (two each of H2A, H2B, H3, H4), with positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine) gripping the negatively charged DNA like powerful magnets. Histone H1 acts like a safety clasp, securing the DNA ends to prevent unraveling - much like the plastic tips on shoelaces that keep them from fraying.</p><p>These nucleosome spools then coil into a <strong>30-nanometer fiber</strong>, resembling a tightly wound spring. During normal cell activity, these springs form <strong>300-nanometer loops</strong> anchored to the nuclear scaffold - imagine different colored threads neatly arranged on a giant spool to prevent tangling. When cells prepare to divide, this genetic thread supercoils into visible <strong>metaphase chromosomes</strong>, compacting DNA with the efficiency of fitting an entire skyscraper’s worth of blueprints into a single filing cabinet!</p><p>This packaging system serves as nature’s ultimate <strong>information management system</strong>. Loosely packed <strong>euchromatin</strong> (like an open notebook) allows easy access to genetic instructions, while tightly packed <strong>heterochromatin</strong> (like a locked safe) keeps unnecessary genes silent. It’s the perfect balance - extreme compression with instant access, much like how modern computers use sophisticated algorithms to store vast amounts of data while maintaining lightning-fast retrieval.</p><p>This sophisticated packaging system demonstrates how cells masterfully balance DNA compaction with functional accessibility, ensuring both genetic stability and precise regulation of gene expression. Biology, that’s the magic.</p>]]></content>
